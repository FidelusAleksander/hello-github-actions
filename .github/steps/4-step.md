## Step 4: Trigger the workflow

_You've now added a fully functioning workflow to your repository! :smile:_

The shell script in the workflow will run whenever a new pull request is opened.

### üìñ Theory: Seeing your action in action

> [!NOTE]
> The status of each workflow run that's triggered is shown in the pull request before it's merged. You can also see a list of all the workflows that are running, or have finished running, in the **Actions** tab of your repository.

### ‚å®Ô∏è Activity: Trigger the workflow

1. In the **Pull requests** tab, create a pull request that will merge `welcome-workflow` into `main`.
1. Watch the workflow running in the checks section of the pull request.
1. Notice the comment that the workflow adds to the pull request.
